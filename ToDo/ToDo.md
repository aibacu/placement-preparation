### ðŸ’¡ Random Thought / Idea

Today, while going through the [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university) repository, I studied the README where the author explained in detail how he prepared for interviews. One interesting point he mentioned was the idea of using **flashcards** to reinforce learning and memory.

Inspired by that, Iâ€™ve decided to build a small practice project: a **Flashcard Web App**. The goal is to create a tool that can help me quickly revise key concepts, especially for DSA and core CS subjects.

### ðŸ’¡ Random Thought
Saw a post where someone turned LeetCode submissions into a progress graph.  
Could be cool to auto-generate it using GitHub Actions + Python script.
